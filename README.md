# 🗳️ Smart Voting System - Shadow Strikers

A secure and offline-capable voting system developed by Team Shadow Strikers. Designed for use in polling booths with integrated QR code and biometric authentication to ensure fast, secure, and tamper-proof voter verification.

## 🔧 Features
- ✅ Offline functionality using local database (up to 1,500 voters)
- 🔍 QR code-based voter identification
- 🧠 Biometric verification for double authentication
- 💾 Local data storage (secure and encrypted)
- 🖥️ User-friendly interface built with FlutterFlow

---

## 🏗️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** FlutterFlow
- **Backend:** Local database (SQLite / similar)
- **Verification:** QR Code Scanner, Biometric Module

---

## 🚀 How It Works
1. Voter scans QR code sent via official channel.
2. System matches QR with the local database.
3. Fingerprint/biometric authentication confirms identity.
4. If verified, voter is allowed to cast the vote.

## 🧪 Future Plans
- Sync data with central database once online
- Add facial recognition as an optional verification method
- Integrate real-time monitoring and analytics
